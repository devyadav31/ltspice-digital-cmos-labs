"A collection of 12 academic lab assignments on CMOS digital logic design using LTspice. Includes schematics, simulations, waveform plots, and analysis reports."
# LTspice CMOS Digital Logic Labs

This repository contains 12 lab assignments from my Digital VLSI Design coursework at IIIT Surat. The labs cover:

- CMOS and resistive inverters
- NAND, NOR, XNOR gate design
- Pass-transistor, pseudo-NMOS, DCVSL, TGL logic styles
- Parametric sweeps, transient analysis, delay and power estimation
- Dynamic logic gates and clocked SR latch

Each lab includes:
- LTspice simulation files
- Reports with analysis
- Annotated waveform plots
